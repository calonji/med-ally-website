    a: 'The physician reviews the generated draft, makes any needed edits, validates the content, and approves what moves forward in the workflow.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How does the approved note reach the clinical record?',
    a: 'MedAlly is designed to move physician-approved work into the practice workflow, including the EHR workflow where supported by the specific deployment. Exact integration depth can vary, so practices and health systems should confirm support for their environment during evaluation.',

  {
    q: 'Is MedAlly only an AI medical scribe?',
    a: 'No. AI-assisted documentation is one part of MedAlly. The broader platform also organizes encounter context, surfaces reviewable decision-support information, prepares coding context, and supports workflow handoffs.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does MedAlly replace physician review?',
    a: 'No. Physicians remain responsible for reviewing, editing, validating, approving, and making final clinical decisions.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What should I verify about privacy and security?',

const clinicalDocFaqs = [
  {
    q: 'What is AI clinical documentation?',

  {
    q: 'Is AI clinical documentation the same as an AI medical scribe?',
    a: 'Not exactly. An AI medical scribe primarily describes capturing a clinical encounter and drafting a note from the conversation. AI clinical documentation is the broader process of creating, structuring, reviewing, approving, and moving documentation through the clinical workflow.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does MedAlly generate SOAP notes?',
    a: 'Yes. MedAlly prepares SOAP-style clinical documentation from encounter context for physician review. The clinician should review and edit the draft before approval.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can physicians edit AI-generated clinical documentation?',

  },
  {
    q: 'Does MedAlly provide coding information with the documentation?',
    a: 'MedAlly prepares ICD-10/CPT coding context around the encounter for review. Coding output should be reviewed and validated before use.',

  {
    q: 'What should a practice evaluate before choosing clinical workflow software?',

  },
  {
    q: 'How is encounter documentation different from workflow coordination?',
    a: 'Encounter documentation focuses on capturing and structuring the clinical note. Workflow coordination is broader and can include review responsibilities, follow-up, task or status management, coding, handoff, integration, and other steps surrounding the encounter.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is healthcare workflow software the same as clinical workflow software?',
    a: 'Not always. The terms can overlap, but healthcare workflow software may include broader administrative and operational processes in addition to clinician-facing clinical workflows.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What should a practice confirm about EHR handoff?',
    a: 'Confirm the exact transfer method, which systems are supported, what requires clinician approval, what setup is needed, and which behaviors vary by deployment. Do not assume that "EHR integration" means automatic chart commitment.',

    q: 'Where does MedAlly fit within clinical workflow software?',
